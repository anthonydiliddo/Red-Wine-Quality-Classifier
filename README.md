# Red-Wine-Quality-Classifier
Abstract: This study delves into the intersection of wine industry growth and technological advancements, where the evaluation and classification of wine quality play a pivotal role. Leveraging a publicly available dataset featuring 1599 instances of red wine, encompassing 11 diverse features ranging from objective tests like pH values to sensory data derived from expert evaluations, the aim is to predict wine quality ratings. This research focuses on classifying wine quality across six classes of qualities from 3-8, by employing multiple different machine learning algorithms, with the three most distinct data mining algorithms tested being extra trees classifier, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting. Notably, the Random Forests Classifier emerged as the most successful classifier for predicting red wine quality, achieving an accuracy of 70%. To simplify the classification task and address misclassifications observed between qualities, a decision was made to merge these two qualities into a single class which led to a significant improvement in accuracy of the reduced classes. Finally, this study identifies the augmentation of classification success within the Random Forests Algorithm by integrating principal component analysis in feature selection, ultimately allowing for a better prediction of red wine quality given certain physicochemical tests.
